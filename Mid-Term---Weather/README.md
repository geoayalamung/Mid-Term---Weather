# Mid-Term---Weather
Hi guys!

Member 1 (Karla) : Search input + Favorite cities dropdown + Current weather (most confident with JS)

Member 2 (Georgina) : Forecast 5 days.

Member 3 (Fuuta) : 3 hour range.


--The Challenge--
Your challenge is to integrate with the Open Weather API to pull weather data and display it.
Your users should be able to:
Search for a city using an input field.
Save favorite cities by clicking on a star icon.
See the current weather info based on the selected city.
See forecast for the next 5 days.
See weather info for every 3 hours of each day.
Have good experience using desktop or mobile screen sizes.

--Requirements--
These are the requirements that are mandatory for this project:
Follow wireframe to create the structure of your page for desktop and mobile. It is up to you how to design, include images and icons in the project.
Search input should use Google Places Autocomplete for suggesting cities only.
The default city should be based on users’ location. In case the user blocks the location info, Vancouver should be the default.
When the user clicks on the star icon, the city should be included on the dropdown for “Favorite cities”.
Favorite cities should be stored in localStorage. After the page loads, check if there is something saved there. If yes, append city options in the dropdown.
When the user clicks on one of the options for dropdown, the weather info for the selected city should be loaded on the page.
Create Fetch API calls to get the current weather and forecast for the next 5 days.
When the user clicks on one of the cards in the “Daily forecast” section, the “3 hour range” section should change the data based on the day clicked.
SCSS files should be used for styling files.
Media queries should be used for responsive behaviors in the page.
Desktop size: 1440px / Mobile: 375px
